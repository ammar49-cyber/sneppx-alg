## Contributor Tiers

SNEPPX-Algo uses a **five-tier merit-based system**. See `docs/CONTRIBUTOR_TIERS.md` for full details.

| Tier | Role | Can Submit PRs | Can Merge |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|
| T1 | Explorer | No | No |
| T2 | Contributor | Yes | No |
| T3 | Senior | Yes | No (can approve) |
| T4 | Maintainer | Yes | Yes |
| T5 | Core | Yes | Yes (full access) |

Start at Tier 1 (Explorer) by reading the docs, building the project, and submitting an issue.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Ideation

Open an issue describing the bug or feature. For significant changes (Tier 3+), write a Design Document first at `docs/proposals/<feature>.md`.

### 2. Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<track>-<name>
```

Track prefixes: `python`, `c-core`, `security`, `cuda`, `algo`, `docs`, `infra`

### 3. Develop

- Follow `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Run linter: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- Run tests: `ctest -C Release --output-on-failure`
- Sign commits: `git commit -S`

### 4. Submit PR

Open a PR using the template at `docs/PR_TEMPLATE.md`. Reference the issue and design doc (if applicable).

### 5. Review

- Tier 2 contributors need 1 approval from a Senior+
- Tier 3+ contributors may also approve lower-tier PRs
- Security-related changes require an L3 security review
- See `docs/CODE_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` for detailed review criteria

### 6. Merge

Maintainer+ merges via squash or rebase. PR must have:

- Green CI
- All conversations resolved
- Signed commits
- Approval from required reviewers

### 7. Post-Merge

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` if user-facing
- Name added to `AUTHORS` (first merged PR)
