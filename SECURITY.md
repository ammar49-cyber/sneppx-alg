| S9 | Planned v1.0 | Penetration testing: third-party audit, bug bounty |

## Known Issues

No reported vulnerabilities at this time.

### Test Suite Edge Cases

- Ed25519: Fixed to full RFC 8032 compliance (all 4 test vectors pass). The base-point T-ordering bug (init_base_point computed B.T before parity negation) has been resolved.
- Argon2: 1/4 timing test fails on certain hardware
- These are pre-existing S0 limitations and do not represent security vulnerabilities

### S2 Obfuscation — Audit Findings (2026-08-16)

See `docs/security/obf_audit.md` for the full audit report. Key findings:
- **Critical:** S2 uses `rand()` (CWE-338) for obfuscation decisions — predictable seed makes all choices reproducible
- **High:** Whitebox AES table lookups are timing-variable (CWE-208)
- **Medium:** `bogus_cf_redirect` has no restore path; XOR with hardcoded `0xDEADBEEF` is trivially reversible (CWE-327)
- Known issues tracked in `docs/security/obf_audit.md`
