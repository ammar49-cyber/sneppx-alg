- ChaCha20-Poly1305 (RFC 8439) AEAD: encrypt/decrypt
- SHA-3 (FIPS 202): 224/256/384/512
- SHA-256 (FIPS 180-4): General-purpose hashing
- BLAKE3: Fast hashing
- Argon2id (RFC 9106): Secure KDF with timing defense
- Secure Random: OS CPRNG (Windows CNG / Linux getrandom)
- Kyber-512/768/1024 (FIPS 203 ML-KEM): PQ key encapsulation
- Dilithium-2/3/5 (FIPS 204 ML-DSA): PQ digital signatures

## S1 — Memory Hardening

**Purpose:** Runtime memory protection against corruption, leakage, and exploitation.

**Components:**
- Guard pages: Inaccessible pages placed before/after heap allocations
- Stack canaries: Random values on stack, checked before function return
- ASLR: Random base addresses for heap/mmap allocations
- Locked memory: `mlock()` / `VirtualLock` to prevent swapping of secrets
- Secure wipe: `memset` with compiler barrier (prevents optimizer removal)
- Constant-time comparison: Timing-attack-resistant memcmp
- Memory leak detector: Tracks allocations, reports unfreed blocks

## S2 — Obfuscation Engine

**Purpose:** Protect against reverse engineering and static analysis.

**Components:**
- Control flow flattening: switch-based dispatch replaces natural control flow
- String encryption: XOR-based compile-time obfuscation with rotating keys
- Instruction substitution: NAND-gate equivalent sequences
- Opaque predicates: always-true/false branches
- Code virtualization: basic-block bytecode with encrypted dispatch table
- Anti-debug: ptrace, NtGlobalFlag, timing anomaly, breakpoint scanning
- Binary substitution: opcode-level replacement with prefix/suffix bytes
- Junk code insertion: NOP slides, dead-store MOVs, identity XORs
- Constant unfolding: integer constants as `(a + b)` with random splits
- IAT protection: hash-based import resolution, integrity scanning
- SEH/VEH obfuscation: exception-based control flow
- TLS callback obfuscation: runtime function pointer encoding
- Anti-dump: PE/ELF header XOR encryption with CRC integrity
- Multi-VM diversity: multiple bytecode handlers with slot switching
- Instruction scheduling randomization: basic-block-level reordering

## Threat Model

**Assumptions:**
- Hardware is trusted (no side-channel attacks on CPU)
- OS is trusted (no kernel-level compromise)
- Network is untrusted
- Other AI models are untrusted and potentially adversarial
- Supply chain is trusted (verified commits, signed releases)

**Defenses:**

| Threat | Defense |
|--------|---------|
| Signature forgery | Ed25519 |
| Data breach at rest | ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Side-channel timing | Constant-time ops |
| Memory scraping | Locked memory + guard pages |
| Swap forensic | `mlock` / `VirtualLock` |
| Reverse engineering | CF flattening + string encryption |
| Runtime tampering | Behavioral monitor |
| Adversarial input | ARC input guard + adversarial training |
| Gradient leakage | ARC gradient obfuscation |
| Model inversion | ARC output verifier |
