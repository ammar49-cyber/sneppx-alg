## Elevator Pitch

SNEPPX-Algo is the first open-source AI algorithm with cryptographic integrity — neuro-symbolic execution where every inference is verifiable, every execution path is tamper-proof, and the model evolves on-device without compromising privacy. The algorithm protects itself so you can run it anywhere without trusting the host.

## The Problem

Modern AI has a trust crisis:

1. **Closed models** — You don't know what the model is doing. You send data to an API and get back an answer. The computation is a black box.
2. **Open models can be tampered** — Even if the weights are public, nothing stops a malicious host from modifying the inference code, stealing the model, or poisoning the output.
3. **No verifiability** — There is no way to prove an inference was computed correctly without re-running it yourself.
4. **No on-device privacy** — Most "AI" requires sending your data to the cloud. On-device inference exists but lacks security guarantees.
5. **No open contribution model** — Open-source AI has no way to reward contributors or verify their contributions are honest.

## The Solution

### 1. Neuro-Symbolic Execution
Combine neural network components (HSS, SER) with a symbolic program executor (NPE). The neural parts learn patterns; the symbolic parts verify logical correctness. This is a hybrid that gets the best of both worlds — pattern matching + formal reasoning.

### 2. Cryptographic Integrity
Every inference produces a zero-knowledge proof that it was computed correctly. Users verify the proof without re-running the model. This is mathematically-guaranteed trust.

- **Integrity proof**: "This output is the correct result of model M on input X"
- **Privacy preserving**: The proof reveals nothing about the model weights
- **Public verifiable**: Anyone can check the proof with open-source verifier code

### 3. Self-Protecting Execution
The algorithm encrypts its own memory, obfuscates its control flow, detects debuggers, and virtualizes critical functions. Running SNEPPX on an untrusted host is safer than running any other model anywhere.

- S0: All crypto primitives are constant-time, side-channel resistant
- S1: All allocations have guard pages, canaries, ASLR
- S2: Control flow is flattened, strings are encrypted, handlers are scrambled

### 4. On-Device First
The core algorithm is designed to run on phones and edge devices, not just datacenter GPUs.

- Quantization-aware execution paths
- Sparse compute (MoE routes to only a few experts per token)
- Memory-efficient secure allocator (S1)
- No cloud dependency for inference

### 5. Federated Contribution Protocol
Open-source AI needs an incentive and verification model. SNEPPX lets contributors train shards locally and submit cryptographically signed gradient contributions. The protocol verifies contributions without seeing private data, turning the community into a distributed training network.

- Gradient contributions are signed with Ed25519 (S0)
- Contributions are aggregated via trust-weighted all-reduce (FM)
- Contributors earn reputation scores based on verification

### 6. Formal Safety Guarantees
The behavioral monitor (S3) enforces provable constraints at runtime — not just "detect anomalies" but "prove the output satisfies safety bounds." Combined with the symbolic execution layer, every decision path is auditable.

## Design Principles

1. **Trust is mathematical, not organizational.** Don't ask users to trust a company. Give them a proof.
2. **Security is foundational, not bolted on.** Every layer from the allocator up is hardened.
3. **Open source is non-negotiable.** The code, the proofs, the protocols — all public.
4. **On-device is the default.** Cloud is optional, not required.
5. **Contribute and verify.** The community grows through cryptographically verified contributions.

## What Makes This Next-Gen

Most "next-gen AI" is just bigger models trained on more GPUs. SNEPPX-Algo is next-gen because it rethinks the relationship between the algorithm and the user:

- From black box → verifiable
- From trust-the-company → trust-the-math
- From cloud-only → on-device-first
- From centralized training → federated contribution
- From reactive safety → provable safety

This isn't a better transformer. It's a fundamentally different category of AI system.
