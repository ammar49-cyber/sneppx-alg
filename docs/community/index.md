# Community Showcase

Real projects built on **SNEPPX-Alg**. Each entry is submitted by the
community and carries a **verification badge** indicating how far the SNEPPX
team has validated it.

## Verification badge scheme

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| :material-check-decagram:{ .verified } **Verified** | The SNEPPX maintainers ran the demo end-to-end on the current release and confirmed it reproduces. |
| :material-shield-check:{ .self-verified } **Self-verified** | The author asserts it runs; source is inspected but not reproduced by maintainers. |
| :material-eye:{ .community } **Community** | Submitted by a user; listed as-is with no formal verification. |
| :material-alert-octagon:{ .needs-review } **Needs review** | Submitted but not yet audited (may include unverified claims). |

> Badges are **not** security attestations. "Verified" only means "it ran when
> we tried it" — see [`docs/api/index.md`](../api/index.md) for formal
> verification (S8) of the core itself.

## Submit your project

1. Fork `ammar49-cyber/sneppx-alg`.
2. Add a row to the table below (alphabetical by title) under the appropriate
   badge level, keeping the same column order.
3. Open a pull request with the subject `community: add "<title>"`.

Your PR must include a short `README`-style blurb (≤ 120 words) and a link to
public source. Maintainers will re-run the demo and **upgrade** the badge to
**Verified** if it reproduces without changes. If it does not reproduce, the
entry is marked **Needs review** and the author is pinged.
